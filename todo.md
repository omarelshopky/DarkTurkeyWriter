# Features:
- Stubborn text editor
- The screen will by something like the real app but with your adjustment
- You can specify how long you want to stay locked by timer or words
- size of writing space should be 1 of 3rd current size, 1st writing space is 30 per cent of original so I can write paragraph by paragraph not page by page
- Every time while writing I hit enter text is saved to initial file and I start new paragraph from the top, if I set up limit 1000 words and start writing every time I hit enter text is saved and I start writing from the top new paragraph
- If don't write for 3 seconds text starts desapering.. every 3 second new world, every time I stop writing for longer than 3 seconds one word desapering another 3 seconds another word desapering . This action is automatically cancelled when I start typing

Basically I want to write one paragraph at the time, not whole page


At the end of session benith progress bar must be pop up save button like in original app. All functionality must be like in original app including saving text every 10 seconds in case app or computer crashed

If I decide to add same additional features you will get paid extra. Be cool and develop good no bugs app there will be bonus. I like you , you are 100 per cent professional you defenetly stand out from others. Let's do this. Good luck
S
One more - writing space size must be fixed when text extended writing space is automatically saved and I start writing from top. That is it. See you
